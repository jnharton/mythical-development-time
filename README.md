MDT is a game about how software development time really works. More developers does not equal more productivity, in fact since existing developers have to train new ones and the new ones are not familiar with the exact work at the beginning despite basic skills/talent they are a productivity sink for a while…

**Get/Play:**

    Download Love2D interpreter (zipped file is good here) – https://www.love2d.org/
    Download mdt.love
    Drag mdt.love onto Love2D executable

**Goal:**

    Is there a goal? IDK. The point is to experience the pain of watching productivity decrease when you hire a new developer.

**How to play:**

    h - hire a developer
    d - purchase a desk
    a - assign developer to first available desk
    plus - speed up simulation
    minus - slow down simulation

**NOTE1:** It is recommended to set “speed” fairly high, perhaps 20-50+ (max 100) to avoid being incredibly bored  
**NOTE2:** Love2D console is still enabled since proper notification messages aren’t implemented (in case you wonder why you can’t buy another desk)

^ a truly awesome template to get started making games. provides a basic menu and state switching plus bundling require’ing a bunch of common libraries.

*NOTE:* the files included in this repository were downloaded some time in late December 2017
